# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn lint`

Runs eslint in the src folder with the automatic fix option enabled (`--fix`).

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn deploy`

The `predeploy` script runs `npm run build` to build the app for production and output to the `build` folder.

The [`gh-pages` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) then takes the contents of the build folder and publishes it to the [`gh-pages` branch on Github](https://github.com/oliver-wilson-dev/world-explorer/tree/gh-pages). [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) takes care of the hosting and allows the application to be hosted at `https://GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/`.

Notice `.env.production` which contains the `PUBLIC_URL` environment variable. This environment variable is added to the `html` `head` under the `base` tag. This allows the app to be served from the `/world-explorer` subdirectory, and also allows us to simulate this during development and when running prod builds locally.
